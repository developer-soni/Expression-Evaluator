# Expression-Evaluator or Calculator


This project served as an introduction to Object Oriented Design and its concepts to provide structure and scalability to the code. The goal was to implement an expression evaluator class with specific and correct operators and operands and the rules. The expressions would be read by String Tokenizer class in Java and are stored as “tokens”. Each token will be pushed into two different stacks i.e. Operator and Operand class for each token. They will then be operated upon based on simple priority rules for +, -, /, *, ^, (,). It will take single tokens or variables and then compute them based on its priority in the whole equation and also based on simple mathematics rules. Then outputs the calculated answer. Invalid equations or expressions won’t work because they are invalid so one has to erase them and write one that can be computed. The code is connected to an interface which displays a mini calculator for you to perform actions.
